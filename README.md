Game play
The one image the users enter will be bread down into 9 pieces of images. Then, the images are mix up randomly. And, the users finally start the game to assemble the debris of images together to make out the original one the users loaded at the beginning of the game. Once the user finish building the original picture, the game is over with a timer information the users take.
 File Reading and Writing
When the game starts, the user nickname is loaded and displayed on pop-up window running in the background. Also, one the game is over, timer displayed will stop. Therefore, the nicknames and timer will be written and scanned and read from the file created to display the user information in the pop-up window including the record of the user ranking when the user clicks on ‘RESULT’.
